# God Bread "PÃ£o de Deus"

Makes 8-10 buns

Dough:
- 330 mL milk
- 60 g sugar
- 8 g fresh yeast
- 510 g plain flour
- 5 g salt
- 85 g butter
- powdered sugar

Topping:
- 1 egg
- 2 egg yolks
- 250 mL milk
- 40 g plain flour
- 75 g sugar
- 250 g grated coconut

1. Mix all dough ingredients, except the butter, and knead for 5 minutes.
2. Slowly add butter to the mix and keep kneading for roughly 4 minutes.
3. Place dough in a sealed container and cool it down in the fridge for 1 hour.
4. Split the dough into 80 g balls and space them out on a baking tray. Cover the tray and keep at room temperature until the balls double in size (time?).
5. Meanwhile, make the coconut topping:
    1. Heat the milk on the stove, to boiling point.
    2. Combine all other ingredients, except the coconut and slowly incorporate them into the milk, on a low simmer until everything thickens a bit.
    3. Turn off the heat and add the coconut.
6. Once doubled in size, pre-heat the oven at 180C and add the coconut topping on top of the buns.
7. Bake the buns for 15-20 minutes.
8. Once cooled, dust them with powdered sugar.
