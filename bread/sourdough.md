Makes one loaf.

**Levain build**
  - 50g sourdough starter
  - 50g flour
  - 50g water

**Dough mix**
  - 453g flour
  - 345g water at room temp
  - 9g salt
  - 92g levain

**Steps**

1. _08:00_ - **Levain**. Mix everything in the levain build, cover and leave at room temp for 5 hours.
2. _12:00_ - **Autolyse**. Mix flour and 295g water, cover and leave at room temp for 1 hour.
3. _13:00_ - **Mix**. Add salt, 50g water and 92g levain to flour and water mix. Combine by pinching. Keep rest of levain in the fridge for 1 week.
4. _13:10_ - **Ferment**. Cover and leave to ferment for 4 hours. After 30 minutes, perform the first of 3 **sets** of stretch and folds during this period. Each set should be spaced out by 30 minutes. After the 3rd set, let dough rest until next step.
   - **Set**: Wet your hands to prevent sticking. Lift up North side with both hands, fold it over South completely. Repeat for South, East and West.
5. _17:10_ - **Preshape**. Lightly flour the work surface and dump out the dough. Flour one hand, bench knife on the other: turn the dough on the counter while lightly pulling the dough towards you develop tension on top and form a round circle. Leave rest for 25 mins, uncovered.
6. _17:35_ - **Shape**
    1. Lightly flour the work surface, the dough top and your hands.
    2. Flip the dough over so its top is on the bench.
    3. With both hands, grab South, stretch it lightly down and fold up to 2/3 of the way to the top.
    4. Grab East and West and stretch each side lightly apart and fold them one on top of the other, each 2/3 of the way.
    5. Grab North, stretch it lightly up and fold all the way down. The folds should resemble a letter.
    6. Flip the dough over so the seams are on the bottom.
    7. Using two hands cup the top part of the dough and drag it gently towards yourself, in order to create more tension.
    8. Let rest for a few minutes. Then, place seam-side-up into proofing bowl, lightly dusted with rice flour. Cover with plastic wrap sealed shut with rubber band. Let rest on the counter for 20 minutes.
    9. Place in the fridge for 16 hours.
7. _08:30_ - **Bake**
    1. Preheat dutch oven for at least 30 minutes at 260C.
    2. Cut parchment paper, place it on top of basket. Place a board on top and flip it over.
    3. Score the loaf of bread using a knife.
    4. Bake covered for 20 minutes at 245C.
    5. Bake uncovered for 30 minutes at 230C.
