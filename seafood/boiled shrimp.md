# Boiled Shrimp

- quality raw shrimp
- water
- salt
- piri-piri (optional)

Make sure shrimp is thawed, if you keep it frozen.

1. Get a very large bowl and fill it with plenty of ice cold water, add some ice cubes to it. Season it with lots of salt, to the point of tasting like ocean water.
2. Fill a large pot with plenty of water and get it boiling, max heat.
3. Drop the shrimp in the boiling pot of water, add it carefully as not to drop the boiling too much. Leave the shrimp in for no longer than 3 minutes. As the shrimp gets orange/red, it is cooked.
4. Using a pierced ladle, quickly transfer the shrimp over to the ice cold water bowl. This will stop the cooking process and season the shrimp. Drain the shrimp after 7-10 minutes.
