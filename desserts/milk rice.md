# Milk Rice - "Arroz Doce"

- 1 cup of carolino rice
- 2 cups hot water
- 1 pinch of salt
- 3/4 cup of sugar
- 2 translucent lemon peels
- 1 stick of cinnamon
- 2 cups 1/2 warm medium-low milk
- 1 cup butter
- 2 egg yolks (at room temperature)
- cinnamon powder for sprinkling

Wash and bake the rice in 2 cups well filled with hot water with a pinch of salt, on a low heat. Allow to absorb all the water completely, checking if the rice is well cooked (if necessary, add some more water).

Add the sugar, lemon peel, cinnamon stick, milk and vegetable butter to the pot and stir until the sugar dissolves. Continue stirring gently until the preparation begins to boil and thickens slightly (about 6 to 8 minutes).

Meanwhile, stir the yolks into a bowl until they are undone. Add two to three tablespoons of the preparation and mix well (serve to heat the egg yolks and do not risk cutting them when you put them in the pot on the fire).

Remove the lemon peel and cinnamon stick from the pan and add the yolks to the yolks, stirring constantly, in a very low heat, until the preparation thickens (another 3 to 5 minutes), removing the heat according to taste, that is, more or less liquid (here at home we like the rice very creamy, reason why the retreat of the lume still very liquid, when cool, absorbs the residual liquid and maintains the creaminess).

Pour the rice into a bowl or individual bowls and sprinkle with cinnamon powder. Serve warm or cold.
