# Caldo Verde

- olive oil
- 1 bunch collard greens or kale, stems removed, finely sliced
- 1 medium onion, finely sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, finely sliced
- salt, pepper
- 4/5 medium soup potatoes, choped in chunks
- 1L chicken or vegetable stock
- chouriço, finely sliced

Heat olive oil in dutch oven over medium heat. Add greens, onion and garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until softened but not brown, about 5 minutes.

Add potatoes and stock. Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Keep simmer for 30 minutes, until potatoes break apart easily. Use a potato masher to break down the potatoes. Cook for 10 additional minutes. Add most of the chouriço slices, simmer for 2 more minutes.

Serve in soup plates, garnish with chouriço slices.
